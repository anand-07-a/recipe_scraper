The ice cream can be frozen for up to 4 months.
Look for canned or frozen mango pulp or puree that's 100% mango with no added sugar or stabilizers. Brands like Deep, Swad, or Kesar mango puree are widely available in Indian or international grocery stores and online. If using fresh mango, puree and cook it down with sugar to concentrate flavor and reduce moisture.
